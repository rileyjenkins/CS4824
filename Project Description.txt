We will be using machine learning based on data from Argentina in order to
determine if a student is at a risk of being bullied, physically, verbally, or on the
internet based on certain social characteristics. Cross-national surveys [1][2] 
in the past have found that a quarter to a third of
students have been victimized while at school, illustrating that bullying is a
significant problem facing schools around the world. Factors that cause students
to be victimized include being socially isolated [3], and the degree of homophily
within bullying groups, which assesses how much students choose friends based
on similar behaviors and attitudes [4]. As far as we know, there are currently no machine learning models which can
predict if a student will get bullied based on student characteristics such as
loneliness and number of friends. Only one paper exists around predicting
student risk of bullying using social graphs using data solely on past incidents of
bullying [5]. For the data set being used, we will use data from the World Health
Organization’s 2018 Global School-based Health Survey for Argentina, which can
be found here. The survey includes a wide variety of questions around student
academic and social lives in school and their personal lives outside of school.
However, we will select specific questions relevant to our project based on past
research that’s been done on factors that cause students to be bullied.
Currently we have selected questions around reported perceptions of loneliness
and number of friends as features in our model to determine if these factors can
predict the risk of cyber bullying, verbal bullying, and physical bullying. This is
due to research around bullying that’s found social isolation to be a significant
factor that causes students to be bullied at school.
